# Popular-Data-Science-Questions

**in this project** we will have data from Data Science Stack Exchange (DSSE)
we will explore this data to know 
 - "What is it that people want to learn about in data science?"
 - "what is the current trend?" 
 
and to ensure that :

 - "Is deep learning just a fad?" 
 - "Could interest in deep learning be slowing down?"
